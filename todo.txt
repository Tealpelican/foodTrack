basic layout of page

7 days of the week on top, split into 4 sections per day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks
each card has day (maybe date) as the title in a rounded box (like a playing card)
below the cards is a few buttons for doing things like
- search for meal -> select type, then all meals populate a list below -> drag and drop (or +/- from a card, +/- brings up new dialog to select the day card)
- randomize full week, randomize day
- create a meal -> brings up a new card with meal name like the day cards -> it has a + button at the bottom, each time this is pressed a sdet of ingredient cards come up
-- you then select through the cards until you get your ingredient then you click it to add

basic MVP
ingredients, meals, planner
no creation or randomizing for initial run

step 1
create a card object which has a title (name, cals)
look like this
--------------------
[MealName    0 cals]
[------------------]
[Ingredient1 x cals]
[Ingredient2 x cals]
--------------------
